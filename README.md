# ball-in-goal-game

The goal of this project is to develop a rudimentary soccer style game.

There will be a small goal that moves randomly after each goal scored.
The user will move the ball with their arrow keys on the keyboard and shoot with the spacebar.

This project may be a bit above my skill level at this point in my coding journey but I'm going to give it a shot!
